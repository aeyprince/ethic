We're always looking for new localizations of Contributor Covenant and are thankful to the volunteers who spend their time on translations.
Instructions for translators can be found [here](https://github.com/ContributorCovenant/contributor_covenant#translating).

The Contributor Covenant uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
for revisions so all URLs are permanent.
